ImgSource was a product created by Smaller Animals Software. The last update to their webpage contained this text:

End Of The Line
Smaller Animals Software has been in business for 23 years. And it's been fun 
for every one of them. But, we've reached a point where the cost of keeping 
the virtual doors open far exceeds what sales bring in. And so, with much 
regret, we will be shutting down Smaller Animals Software. The proposed final 
date of operation is May 31, 2016. After that date, sales and support of all 
Smaller Animals Software products will cease. 

We realize this is inconvenient for our customers. And we wish there was a 
way we could continue to develop and support the products we've been working 
on for all these years. But, there doesn't seem to be a way to do that. 

We would like to thank all of our customers and especially those who have 
stuck with us over the years and have contributed greatly with their feedback 
and suggestions. It seems safe to say that the majority of the features in our 
products came directly from user suggestions. We wouldn't have done it 
without you.

Out Of Business
Smaller Animals Software is out of business.

I have attempted to contact Smaller Animals Software several times over the
last year to no avail. Therefore I believe that ImgSource is entirely
abandoned and to that end, in order to support those who use my software,
which I based on ImgSource, I am now releasing my software including the
pieces of ImgSource that I incorporated and the key that supported it. This
is necessary to support my software in the absence of Smaller Animals
Software and I believe that I have made reasonable efforts to contact
Smaller Animals Software in order to make alternate arrangements. Thanks!
